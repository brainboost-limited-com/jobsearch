PayPal - Dublin, Ireland
JAVA SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER

As a Technical Support Engineer at PayPal, I was responsible for providing expert and customer-facing support to software developers who use PayPal APIs and integrations in both Spanish and English markets. This involved helping and supporting merchants during the technology onboarding process and troubleshooting any issues that arose.
I worked with a variety of companies, both small and large, and interacted with other departments internally and externally to ensure smooth communication and organization. I also helped to organize meetings when necessary.
As part of my role, I was responsible for monitoring PayPal APIs endpoints globally on a daily basis and during on-call weekends monthly. This meant providing pro-active support in case of any disasters, dealing with merchants, internal emergency troubleshooting, and technical account managers.
One of my strengths was dealing with merchants who had difficulty receiving payments and did not understand the technical aspects of the process. I was able to troubleshoot and open bugs for developers, pull logs, and analyze information from multiple sources to resolve issues.
I was proficient in using most PayPal internal tools and was able to automate processes and build new tools to make the work more efficient and less tedious for the team.
In addition to my technical skills, I attended various training and certification programs in software security, money laundering, business ethics, soft skills, and customer service. As a result of my hard work and dedication, I received numerous Bravo awards from my colleagues for collaboration and innovation.
I also had the opportunity to participate in company hackathons, where I developed software for charities. My team and I won the Exceeded Design Expectations award for creating a mobile app with a stunning user interface that we showcased in front of an important audience.
To further develop my skills, I attended technology training in Braintree, JavaScript, JQuery, NodeJS, and PayPal APIs and tools. I also proactively created and presented a working software mockup for internal use in front of an audience.
Overall, my experience working at PayPal allowed me to develop a wide range of technical and soft skills, and I am proud of my accomplishments during my time there.

		SOFTWARE PATENT_ COMPUTER IMPLEMENTED ARTIFICIAL COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING SYSTEM
	which now I call_

		The first of its kind subjective artificial intelligence.Zero input technology.
	technology that autocompletes your virtual and physical reality

From scratch I Worked in the product development mockup for the implementation of a Computer-Implemented artificial Cognitive Functioning System. The patent relates to a novel approach towards software design and merges 3 existing concepts that were separated_ Computer Vision, Augmented Reality, and Artificial Intelligence.
Current technology creates a relationship between user  technology in which the user always requests things by providing an INPUT.
I observe the whole current ecosystem and all software and technology is designed from a third-person perspective, even the smartest chat bots are still what I called Legacy Third-Person technology, technology that is hungry for your input at all times and does not care about your comfort.
Current third-person technology makes life simpler in some aspects but it does not become part of yourself and you end up working for the technology rather than the technology for you.
With this unique subjective approach towards technology design we have a framework to improve our own intelligence up to the available computer power.
This subjective radical change in the design of technology enable all of us (including people with cognitive disabilities) to merge with artificial intelligence with no need for brain implants and using current available technology.
